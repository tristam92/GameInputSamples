This sample can be used to see current system controllers and their Vendor ID as well as GameInputDeviceFamily value.
For some reason XBox Elite 2 Controller in wireless mode determined as XBox360 family, while in wired mode it's marked as XBoxOne family. At the same time for example DualSense marked as HID family.
IMO in both cases for Elite controller device should be marked as HID device, since it has additional buttons, which are not marked in any way on standard XBox 360/One controller.
